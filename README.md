# Griglia Campo Minato

This is the grid for a simple version of the Minesweeper game.

1. Create the basic structure using html and css.  
2. Create a javascript function that creates an html element with a certain class and a certain content.  
3. Use the function with a for loop to generate the grid.  
4. Use a for loop to add event listeners to the individual cells to color them blue on click as well as to print the cell number into the console.  
5. Add a button with an event listener to trigger the grid generation (and clear the previous grid if present).

## Bonus:

1. Add html select tag.  
2. Select that tag in javascript and save it as a variable.  
3. Create variables defining the length of a side of the grid (in cells) and the total number of cells.  
4. Create a difficulty setter function that changes the values of those variables.  
5. Add an event listener to the select tag that calls the difficulty setter function to change the grid generation parameters based on the selected difficulty.
